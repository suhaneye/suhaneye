## About

I enjoy working at the intersection of messy real-world problems and structured technical solutions.

Currently spending a lot of time understanding how data actually flows:
from raw operational sources → cleaned datasets → decisions.

I like debugging pipelines, improving reliability, and automating repetitive analysis.

---

## What I do (recently)

During my time working with consulting teams, I’ve been:
- extracting and cleaning large datasets using Python and SQL
- investigating data inconsistencies and broken reporting logic
- translating business questions into reproducible analysis
- building dashboards and analytical tools used by decision-makers
- working with internal analytics platforms and real operational data

What I learned:
> most real problems are not algorithm problems — they are data problems.

---

## Things I’m exploring now
- writing ETL pipelines that don’t silently fail
- query performance & indexing
- database behavior under concurrency
- distributed processing (Spark)
- designing small backend services

---

## Projects on this profile
You’ll mostly find experiments around:

• data ingestion  
• ETL workflows  
• log processing  
• backend scripts  
• automation tools  

I prefer simple systems that do one job reliably.

## Tech

**Languages**  
Python, SQL

**Data & Systems**  
PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Data Modeling, Warehousing

**Processing**  
Apache Spark, PySpark, Airflow

**Tools**  
Git, Linux, AWS (S3, EC2), Power BI, Tableau

---

## Principles I try to follow
- automate what you repeat
- log everything
- readable code > clever code
- validate inputs early
- failures should be visible

---

## Outside code
Long walks, notebooks full of half-finished ideas, and occasionally over-engineering personal tools.
