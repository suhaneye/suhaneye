I like understanding how data behaves inside real systems.

Most of my time is spent working with messy datasets, debugging inconsistencies, and turning one-off analysis into repeatable workflows.

## Recently

I’ve been working with operational datasets using Python and SQL — cleaning, validating, and investigating issues in reporting logic.  
I often end up tracing problems back to data pipelines rather than dashboards.

That pushed me toward learning how data systems are actually built.

## Currently exploring
- ETL pipelines and scheduling
- database indexing and query plans
- reliability in data workflows
- distributed processing (Spark)
- small backend services

---

## What you'll find here
Small, practical projects around:
- data ingestion
- automation scripts
- log analysis
- backend utilities

I prefer systems that are simple, observable, and reproducible.
